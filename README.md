# TINUSerialization

Library with useful extensions to `Decodable` and `Encodable` types, including simple JSON/Plist serialization and deserialization.

# Features and usage



```swift

```

# Who should use this Library?

This library should be used by Swift apps/programs that needs to operate with JSON/Plist files, either locally or remotely.

This code is tested on macOS, iPadOS, iOS and macCatalyst only.

# About the project

This code was created as part of my TINU project (https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU) and has been separated and made into it's own library to make the main project's source less complex and more focused on it's aim. 

Also having it as it's own library allows for code to be updated separately and so various versions of the main TINU app will be able to be compiled all with the latest version of this library.
